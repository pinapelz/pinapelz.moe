It would seem that I, along with what seems like the entirety of [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1pcq5ug/how_to_get_customer_support_for_recall_iniu/) bought the same cheap 10000mAh power bank and now its getting recalled.

I wonder if it has anything to do with the poor quality they found in that viral [Haribo Powerbank](https://www.lumafield.com/first-article/posts/whats-hiding-inside-haribos-power-bank-and-headphones). Not sure since I've had this one for a long time. I guess I really got what I paid for, shame cause it really is super slim and works well.

**But I'd definetly prefer for it not to blow up on me**
