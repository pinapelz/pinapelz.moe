There's a thing here in Canada where certain theaters have these special seats that rumble and move in motion with whats happening on screen.

I recently saw the new Avatar (Fire and Ash) in one of these seats. It wasn't a bad experience but given the markup, I don't think its worth it:

- First it is fun (sometimes). For example when they were flying through the air, the seat would tilt in the motion of them flying. Or when there was an explosion/gunfire, the seat would rumble
- However, for me I think they overdid it at times, literately the seat would move and rumble for the smallest things. So it was kind of like a constant thing throughout the whole film. For me its a bit annoying
- For the $10-15 extra (I think I paid a bit more cause the movie was also in 3D), I'd much rather just go to a theater that has the big comfy recliner seats
- I think for the right movie (maybe something heavy on action or horror) this could be a solid purchase if its a movie you're really looking forward to
- Or I also know that some people see movies multiple times, so maybe this can be a good option for a 2nd viewing?

Generally, though... I think I'll live without them.
