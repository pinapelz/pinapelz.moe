      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a thing here in Canada where certain theaters have these special seats that rumble and move in motion with whats happening on screen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently saw the new Avatar (Fire and Ash) in one of these seats. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a bad experience but given the markup, I don&amp;rsquo;t think its worth it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First it is fun (sometimes). For example when they were flying through the air, the seat would tilt in the motion of them flying. Or when there was an explosion/gunfire, the seat would rumble&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;However, for me I think they overdid it at times, literately the seat would move and rumble for the smallest things. So it was kind of like a constant thing throughout the whole film. For me its a bit annoying&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the $10-15 extra (I think I paid a bit more cause the movie was also in 3D), I&amp;rsquo;d much rather just go to a theater that has the big comfy recliner seats&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I think for the right movie (maybe something heavy on action or horror) this could be a solid purchase if its a movie you&amp;rsquo;re really looking forward to&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Or I also know that some people see movies multiple times, so maybe this can be a good option for a 2nd viewing?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, though&amp;hellip; I think I&amp;rsquo;ll live without them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>INIU Power Bank Gets Recall</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It would seem that I, along with what seems like the entirety of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1pcq5ug/how_to_get_customer_support_for_recall_iniu/&#34;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; bought the same cheap 10000mAh power bank and now its getting recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if it has anything to do with the poor quality they found in that viral &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lumafield.com/first-article/posts/whats-hiding-inside-haribos-power-bank-and-headphones&#34;&gt;Haribo Powerbank&lt;/a&gt;. Not sure since I&amp;rsquo;ve had this one for a long time. I guess I really got what I paid for, shame cause it really is super slim and works well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think having control of your own data is great. The same is true for decentralized social media. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a primary user of microblog platforms (like Twitter/X). Having experienced both the traditional and &amp;ldquo;decentralized&amp;rdquo; approaches to microblogs, they both have some particular shortcoming in terms of what I want to get out of &amp;ldquo;social media&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;twitterx&#34;&gt;Twitter/X&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is fairly self explanatory. The rebranding of Twitter to X and Musk&amp;rsquo;s new ownership of the platform shifted the direction of the platform to be ever more political. X Premium boosting visibility is also something I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a particular fan of. You can&amp;rsquo;t view anything without signing in either, so goodbye viewing stuff anonymously. There&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo; here I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of. Needless to say, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of reasons to not post stuff there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
